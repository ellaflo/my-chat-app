# Workplace Chat App



## Description
A real-time chat app for colleagues to hangout and chat with each other about work or fun. This is a simple chat application built using React, Socket.IO, CORS, Express and Body Parser. The application allows users to join a chat room, send messages to other users in the chat room, and receive real-time updates on the status of other users in the room (i.e. when they are typing a message).

The application uses local storage to store a user's username when they join a chat room. If a user leaves the chat room, their username is removed from local storage.

## User Story
As a user, I want to participate in a chatroom with my colleagues. When I enter the chatroom, I can instant message my other team members in the chat room. In the chatroom, I can see all the messages sent by other users and my own messages. I can see a status message that indicates when other users are typing. The most recent message is always displayed at the bottom of the chat window.
When I click the "Leave Chat" button, I am logged out and redirected to the homepage.
